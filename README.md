# Test 1
## Test 2
### Test 3
* just testing
* testing the waters 

Remember that constants should be capitalized

```java
final int BIG = 10_000_000;
```

During the class, I learned about different infinities using Jshell. It also was determined that computers do not really do math the same way as humans.

```java

Integer.MAX_VALUE
Double.MAX_VALUE + 1
```

**NOTE**

Use *JSHELL* to experiment with Java
